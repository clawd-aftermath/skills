A collection of AI-agent skills for interacting across the [Aftermath Finance](https://aftermath.finance) ecosystem.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are structured knowledge files that teach AI coding agents (like Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) how to effectively work with Aftermath's tools, APIs, and protocols. Each skill is a self-contained Markdown document that provides an agent with the context, patterns, and best practices it needs to accomplish tasks within a specific domain.

Think of them as specialized instruction sets — when you point your AI agent at a skill file, it gains deep knowledge about that part of the Aftermath ecosystem without needing to figure things out from scratch.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [API](./skills/api/SKILL.md) | Perpetuals, CCXT, DCA, staking, pools, prices, SDK flows, and operational safety | Stable |
| [Gas](./skills/gas/SKILL.md) | Sui Move gas analysis and optimization | Stable |

> More skills will be added as new integration surfaces arise. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) below.

## Getting Started

### With Claude Projects / Custom Instructions

Add the relevant `SKILL.md` file contents to your AI agent's system prompt or project knowledge base.

### With Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf

Point the agent at the skill file directly:

```
Read ./skills/api/SKILL.md and use it to help me fetch pool data from the Aftermath API.
```

### With MCP or Tool-Augmented Agents

Include the skill file as a resource in your agent's context when making requests related to that domain.

```

Each skill lives in its own directory under `skills/`. A skill directory contains at minimum one skill file, but may also include supplementary files like example code, schemas, or reference data.

## Roadmap

Potential future skills (not yet available):

- **Rust SDK** — Working with the `aftermath-sdk-rust` to build integrations programmatically
- **Move Contracts** — Understanding and interacting with Aftermath's on-chain Move modules
